## Exercise 4 - Check bool to print the pattern.py
- Python program to take a variable from user and typecast it to boolean. 
- Made a condition to check whether it(ie bool) is true or false. 
- Now if the condition is True print a right-angle triangle else inverted right angle triangle for  vice versa.

## Exercise 5 - Health management system-Alok, Anuj & Shivam.py
- Python program for health management of Alok, Anuj & Shivam by using their "Diet and Exercise" data.
- Without using external modules and functions (other than date-time).
- This program gives 2 choice to the user, ie. either to "add new information" or to "view the existing data". 
- `Note: It is recommended to add your data before you view the existing data or this program might give some error!!`
---

## Exercise 6 - Snake-Water-Gun game.py
- Game is played between user and pc.
- Pc will get a random value using "random module" .
- User will get 10 opportunity to play the game.
- Whoever makes max number of win out of 10 times will be the winner.
- Also print no. of wins made by user and pc.
---

## Exercise 7 - Healthy_programer.py
- Python program to maintain a good health of a programer.
- Once the user start this program in the back-ground, it will give a reminder to:
  - `Drink Water` -- Every 1hr (437.5ml each hour) in bwt 9am-5pm (Total of 3.5L each day). -- `Drank` button(To reset reminder).
  - `Eye Execise` -- Every 30 min exercise of the eyes. -- `EyDone` button(To reset the reminder).
  - `Physical Activity` -- Every 45 min a physical activity. -- `ExDone`(To reset the reminder).

- You can always change the "Reminder-Time" according to your requirement. 
- This program will generate a "Logfile" to keep all the time stamp and the record of the exact moment when the user " Drinks Water ", " Does Eye Exercise ", and " Performs Pysical activity ".
- You will have to add three short-music files with this program. Name these files exactly as `water.mp3`, `eye.mp3` and `physical.mp3` else there will be an error!. 
---

## Json_In_Python(Reading External Json File).py
- Python Program to read the content of json file in an ordered manner.
- This progran might not work with Nested JSON files (but it work with most of them).
- If there is some error then you can always make some minor changes according to your requirement.
---

## PASSWORD_Generator.py
- A simple python program to generate a string with a random combination of Uppercase, Lowercase, Special characters and Numbers in random order.
- It will give you the "no. of lower-case, upper-case, special-characters and numbers" present in the generated password.
- You can generate password of any length according to your desire.
- It will also give you as many outputs as you desire.
---

## Prog_To_Create_Folders_Acc_To_Given_Range.py
- Program to create folders according to a given range to sort files in folder.
- Eg.  If we have some '.txt' files like: "1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt ......n.txt".
  - Now we want "file_range=5", ie. we will create a folder name '1-5' and in this '1-5' folder will contain "1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 4.txt, 5.txt" ,
  - Similarly '6-10' folder will contain "6.txt, 7.txt, 8.txt, 9.txt, 10.txt" and so on..
  - In this way this program will make a set of 5(file_range) files and separate them in a folder.
  - It will continue this process according to the number of files present.

- `NOTE: This Program will only work if all the files are named with a unique number.`
- `NOTE: This Program will only create the "Folders" according to the "File_Range" but it will not move the files to the created folders.`
